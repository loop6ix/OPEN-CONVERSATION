I HAVE 1 BUSINESS AND 1 NON PROFIT ORGANIZATION UNDER LOOP6
MY WIFE HAS 1 BUSINESS AND 1 NON PROFIT ORGANIZATION. 
THE ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BUSINESS PLANS CAN BE FOUND BELOW. 

I AM REQUESTING JOINT SUPPORT TO SEE THAT WE RECIEVE THE SBA SUPPLEMENTAL TARGETED ADVANCES WE HAVE APPLIED
RECIEVING TWO ARBITRARY AND CAPRECIOUS REJECTIONS FROM THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION, WE DID NOT EVEN CARE TO APPLY FOR FOR THE 2ND TWO. 

RE: SBA Supplemental Targeted Advance Application Number: 3323324902
RE: SBA Targeted EIDL Advance Application Number: 3323324902

1. THE APPLICANT BUSINESS IS ELIGIBLE AS IT IS VIRTUAL AND DISTRIBUTED. BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS DO IN FACT TAKE PLACE IN A LOW INCOME COMMUNITY IF EITHER A) THE 
WEB SERVERS ARE PLACED IN A LOW INCOME COMMUNITY, OR A HUMAN LOCATED WITHIN A LOW INCOME COMMUNITY USES A DEVICE TO ACCESS THE ORGANIZATION'S SERVIECS. 

2. THE APPLICANT BUSINESS CANNOT SUBSTANTIATE THE REQUIRED REDUCTION IN GROSS RECIEPTS TO ESTABLISH AN ECONOMIC LOSS BECAUSE THE RECIEPTS DO NOT YET EXIST. 
SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC MYSELF, AND MANY OTHERS WITH HAIR LIKE MINE HAVE BEEN TERMINATED FROM EMPLOYMENT. IN MY CASE TWICE. AS A RESULT OF THIS, I LOST $70k 
IN WAGES BETWEEN 2019 TO TODAY. CONSIDERING ALL OF THE DATA THE SBA HAS ALREADY TAKEN FROM ME WITHOUT MY CONSENT, PROOF OF WORK OR PROOF OF STAKE, 
THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF CRISIS INHUMANELY CAUSED BY HUMANS WITHIN THE WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT. I CANT EVEN CREATE ECONOMY FOR MYSELF AND MY FAMILY. I CAN'T BE ANGRY ABOUT 
IT. AND I CANNOT DISCUSS IT EITHER. 

3. I HAVE ATTACHED 4 BUSINESS PLANS TO THIS CORRESPONDENCE. THIS SHOULD BE ENOUGH EXPLANATION TO EXPLAIN HOW I WILL OVERCOME FUTURE DECLINE / WITHDRAWL SITUATIONS.
