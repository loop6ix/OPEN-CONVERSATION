Mon, Aug 23, 3:22 - Correspondence sent to a Mr. Lee Fleming and Evangeline Campbell with the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Evangeline has done her job (She provided
contact information for Mr. Fleming). Mr. Fleming clearly does not have a shared understanding of my enviornmental crisis - he has refused to respond. 

lee.fleming@bia.gov,
Evangeline.Campbell@bia.gov

Dear Mr. Fleming,

I am requesting expeditious processing of Certification of degree of Indian or Alaska Native Blood 
AND 
Federal Tribal Recognition of The Olympia National Laboratory. 
FURTHERMORE
My Tribe has petitioned for federal recognition since the Missouri compromise following the War between the States. 

I personally have sought certification of degree of Indian or Alaska Native Blood since February 2005. That is 16 1/2 years Sir. For some reason -- Possibly White Rage --- Federal and Tribal Governments do not have records of previous petitions. 

I find this completely unacceptable, and I will not stand for it. The behavior is consistent with Government corruption and Malfeasance on behalf of yourself and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
HOWEVER
I feel like this is an urgent matter of National Security. 
THEREFORE
In accordance with Joint Doctrine principles of time management, this package of information took me approximately 8 FTE hours to complete - I expect full recognition and approval of my tribe and my family's native blood rights no later than 8/27/2021.
FURTHERMORE   
I understand you are the Authorizing Official and/or Federal authority for such matters of acknowledgement. 

If you are not - I am requesting you immediately forward this correspondence to someone that is an accountable human being. 

My current situation is grave. I am fully vaccinated, yet I am experiencing a crisis due to COVID-19. 
WHEREAS
I am not an attorney, but a 5th Generation combat Veteran who has supported and defended the constitution of the United States of America faithfully and honorably. 
WHEREAS 
I possess a cranial pelt that is tightly coiled - with almost no defined kink pattern unless seen from up close with a very tight o-shaped pattern; and skin the color of environmentally sustainable soil. 
FURTHERMORE 
Under no circumstances should I feel that I am being psychologically coerced into forced labor as a result of debt bondage via bureaucratic inefficiency or politically influenced  human behaviors within the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
FURTHERMORE 
Under no circumstance should I or any human named within this correspondence feel as if they have engaged in a commercial sex act, such as prostitution, as the result of force, threats of force, fraud, coercion or any combination of such means as a result of actions taken by yourself and / or any human compensated for work performed on behalf of the Bureau of Indian Affairs
FURTHERMORE
If you do not possess the will, discipline, creativity and / or authority to help my humans and people - - please do not tell me about it Sir. Tell an approving authority within the bureau of Indian Affairs, and I will discuss this issue with them.
WHEREAS
Currently the deluge of Federal Data is unprecedented, information is nefariously segmented and the current conditions in cyberspace are persistently contested. 
THEREFORE
I feel like I've provided you more than enough information to expeditiously process this application. If I have not - I grant you full authority to complete the documents and/or tell a story that may or may not be missing ---- in an effort to meet my urgent request for expeditious approval by August 27th 2021. 

I have attached the following to this correspondence:

ANNEX A: MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

TO: MR. LEE FLEMING LEE.FLEMING@BIA.GOV; (202) 513-7650 

FROM: DANTE N. LEACH 

CC: SECDEF 

SUBJECT: NON-EXISTENT TRIBAL ROLL No.’s 

1. THEORIES WERE STUDIED AT HARVARD LAW SCHOOL YEARS AGO THAT PROPOSED LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES PRIOR TO THE CIVIL WAR THAT LED TO A POWER DIFFERENTIAL WITH AFRICAN AMERICANS THAT WERE THREE-QUARTERS OF A HUMAN BEING WHEN THE NATION WAS FORMED. FOLLOWING THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR OF THE 19TH CENTURY BETWEEN THE UNION AND THE CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA, THERE WAS AN EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION TO CHANGE IT. HOWEVER THAT TOOK AN ADDITIONAL 100 YEARS TO IMPLEMENT, LEADING TO THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964. 

2. DURING THE 20TH CENTURY, THE SALIENCE OF RACISM AND OTHER ‘ISMS’ WOVEN INTO THE FABRIC OF U.S. SOCIETY, A DEARTH OF INTERSECTION WITHIN THE HUMAN AND INFORMATION DOMAINS RESULTED IN CULTURAL PREJUDICE, DISCRIMINATION, AND ANTAGONISM DIRECTED AGAINST MY TRIBE’S PEOPLE AND HUMANS. 

3. GENETIC INFORMATION WAS USED AS A LEGAL BASIS TO LEAD BIASED SCHOLARSHIP ON WORKER ORGANIZING, METHODOLOGIES, AND ANALYSES TO THWART THE EXPANSION OF ECONOMIC PROSPERITY AMONGST COMMUNITIES IN THE UNITED STATES PREDOMINANTLY COMPRISED OF DESCENDENTS OF ETHIOPIAN NEGUSES WITH HAIR OF WOOL AND FEET OF COPPER. 

4. AS A RESULT, “COLOR-BLIND” AND MERITOCRACY BASED INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAS LED TO THE EXCLUSION OF MYSELF, MY CHILDREN, MY WIFE, MY MOTHER, MY FATHER, MY GRANDPARENTS AND MY GREAT GRANDPARENTS FROM FEDERALLY AND STATE RECOGNIZED TRIBAL ROLLS. THEREFORE DANTE NATHAN LEACH MALCOLM BERNARD LEACH GLADYS HELENIA PETTY LEACH DOROTHY LEE JACKSON PETTY NATHANIEL PETTY SR. LILLIE GAGE JACKSON ROBERT STANTON JACKSON SR. WILLIE PETTY DORCUS DOROTHY ROBINSON PETTY 

DO NOT POSSESS “TRIBAL ROLL NUMBERS” AS OUR TRIBAL COMMUNITIES VERBALLY TOLD US WE WERE ON THE “TRIBAL ROLLS” BUT WE ARE NOT.
