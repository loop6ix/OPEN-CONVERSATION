              SAME US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION STANDARDS A I DID. THE CRIME ANTOINE IS CURRENTLY INCARCERTATED FOR - WITH 99.99% CERTAINTY HE DID NOT COMMITT. THERE IS MUCH ADDITONAL 
              EVIDENCE TO HIS CASE, SUCH AS THE TESTIMONY OF OVER 5 HUMANS THAT WITNESSED HIM NOT COMMIT THE INITIAL CRIME HE IS IN PRISON FOR.
