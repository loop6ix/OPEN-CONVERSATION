ON APRIL 16TH 2019, MY MOTHER GLADYS HELENIA PETTY LEACH WAS SHOT WHILE UNARMED, IN HER PRIVATE DOMICILE FOLLOWING A 'CRISIS' INTERVENTION BY THURSTON COUNTY WA
SHERRIF ANDREW HANSEN. SHE WAS UNARMED. THE OFFICER DID NOT SHOOT HER IN THE HIP, HE SHOT HER IN THE SPINE - DESTROYING HER SPINAL CANAL AND CAUSING PARALYSIS AND
INCONTNENCE. 

SHE WAS HELD IN BONDAGE FOR 8 MONTHS FOLLWING THE ORDEAL. BRYAN GERHARDT WAS HER COURT APPOINTED ATTORNEY. I CONTACTED SEVERAL ATTORNEYS THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH PUGET
SOUND REGION OF WASHINGTON STATE - BOTH WITHIN THURSTON COUNTY AND MASON COUNTY. I OFFERED EACH $50K IN CASH TO TAKE HER CASE AND SEEK JUSTICE. 4 OF THE 5 CONTACTED 
FLAT OUT REFUSED AND SAID THEY WOULD NOT TAKE THE CASE. 1 SAID I WOULD NEED TO PROVIDE $100K FOR THEM TO EVEN REVIEW IT BECAUSE BRYAN GERHARDT WAS A VERY POWERFUL
ATTORNEY

THE POLICE REPORT HAS BEEN REPUDIATED SEVERAL TIMES, BY BOTH THE MASON COUNTY SHERRIFF AND THE THURSTON COUNTY SHERRIFF. 
WHILE INCARCERATED SHE WAS PLACED IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT SEVERAL TIMES. THE GUARDS TOLD HER THAT SHE COULD WALK AND TO STOP FAKING HER INJURIES. SHE DID NOT RECIEVE
ADEQUATE MEDICAL SUPPORT, CAUSING MULTIPLE INFECTIONS. AS OF 2020 SHE WAS GIVEN A LIFE EXPECTANCY OF 6 YEARS DUE TO THIS DISPLAY OF INHUMANITY AND MALFEASANCE ON BEHALF
OF THE THURSTON COUNTY AND MASON COUNTY COMMISSIONERS AND SHERRIFFS. 

THE OLYMPIAN NEWS , KING 5 NEWS, KOMO NEWS 4 AND THE SEATTLE TIMES HAVE ALL REPORTED THE STORY - - WILDLY INACCURATE TO BENEFIT THE PERSPECTIVE OF WHITE RAGE. 
GLADYS WAS TOLD THAT SHE HAD BEEN CONVICTED OF ASSUALT ON A POLICE OFFICER AFTER 8 MONTHS OF INCARCERATION AND 5 SEPERATE MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATIONS CONDUCTED BY 
WESTERN STATE MENTAL HOSPITAL, LOCATED IN PIERCE COUNTY WASHINGTON. 

GLADYS AND I WILL ARE AVAILABLE FOR OPEN DISCUSSION AT EITHER 360 672 0912 REGARDING THIS ISSUE.
